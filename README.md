# Python-Flask-SQL-Table-Website
Website with SQL Connection with which you can Update,Delete and Insert new Entries in the DB. Pretty basic Site and ran on an Apache Webserver with the mod_wsgi Module.
Just for a bit more Context, this was built as an example of how to use flask and sql were I made 3 seperate SQL Tables one filled with Customers, one with products and then one with Orders. The Site itself was 3 seperate Tables and Forms to read the SQL Tables and also update/Insert new Entries into the SQL Database.
